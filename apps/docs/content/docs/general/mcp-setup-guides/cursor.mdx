# MCP Web Search & Scrape in Cursor

Add web scraping and search capabilities to Cursor with AnyCrawl MCP.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Get Your API Key

Sign up at [anycrawl.dev](https://anycrawl.dev) and copy your API key from the dashboard.

### 2. Add to Cursor

Open Settings (`Cmd+,` on Mac, `Ctrl+,` on Windows), search for "MCP", and add:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "anycrawl": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "anycrawl-mcp"],
            "env": {
                "ANYCRAWL_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Replace `your-api-key` with your actual AnyCrawl API key.

### 3. Restart Cursor

Done! You can now search and scrape the web from Cursor.

## Quick Demo

Try these in Cursor Chat (`Cmd+K`):

**Search the web:**

```
Search for TypeScript best practices 2025
```

**Scrape a page:**

```
Scrape anycrawl.dev and tell me what it does
```

**Get documentation:**

```
Scrape the React hooks documentation and explain useEffect
```

**Crawl a website:**

```
Crawl the blog section of example.com and summarize the articles
```

Cursor will automatically use AnyCrawl's search, scrape, and crawl tools.

## Troubleshooting

### Server not responding

1. Check that your API key is valid
2. Ensure you have Node.js 18+ installed
3. Restart Cursor after making configuration changes

### Permission errors

Make sure npx has permission to execute. You may need to install the package globally:

```bash
npm install -g anycrawl-mcp
```

Then update your configuration to use the global package:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "anycrawl": {
            "command": "anycrawl-mcp",
            "env": {
                "ANYCRAWL_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
