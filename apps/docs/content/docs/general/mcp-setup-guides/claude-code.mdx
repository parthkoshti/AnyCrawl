Add web scraping and search capabilities to Claude Code with AnyCrawl MCP.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Get Your API Key

Sign up at [anycrawl.dev](https://anycrawl.dev) and copy your API key from the dashboard.

### 2. Add AnyCrawl MCP Server

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
claude mcp add anycrawl -e ANYCRAWL_API_KEY=your-api-key -- npx -y anycrawl-mcp
```

Replace `your-api-key` with your actual AnyCrawl API key.

Done! You can now search and scrape the web from Claude Code.

## Quick Demo

Try these in Claude Code:

**Search the web:**

```
Search for the latest Next.js 15 features
```

**Scrape a page:**

```
Scrape anycrawl.dev and tell me what it does
```

**Get documentation:**

```
Find and scrape the Stripe API docs for payment intents
```

**Crawl a website:**

```
Crawl the blog section of example.com and summarize the articles
```

Claude will automatically use AnyCrawl's search, scrape, and crawl tools to get the information.

## Available Tools

Once configured, Claude Code will have access to:

- **anycrawl_scrape** - Scrape a single URL and extract content
- **anycrawl_crawl** - Crawl multiple pages from a website
- **anycrawl_search** - Search the web and optionally scrape results
- **anycrawl_crawl_status** - Check crawl job status
- **anycrawl_crawl_results** - Get results from a crawl job
- **anycrawl_cancel_crawl** - Cancel a running crawl job

## Verify Installation

To verify the MCP server is configured correctly:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

You should see `anycrawl` in the list of configured MCP servers.

## Troubleshooting

### Server not responding

1. Check that your API key is valid
2. Ensure you have Node.js 18+ installed
3. Try removing and re-adding the server:

```bash
claude mcp remove anycrawl
claude mcp add anycrawl -e ANYCRAWL_API_KEY=your-api-key -- npx -y anycrawl-mcp
```

### Permission errors

Make sure npx has permission to execute. You may need to run:

```bash
npm install -g anycrawl-mcp
```

Then configure with the global package:

```bash
claude mcp add anycrawl -e ANYCRAWL_API_KEY=your-api-key -- anycrawl-mcp
```
